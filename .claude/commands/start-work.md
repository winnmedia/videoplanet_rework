description: Initialize work by sequentially reading essential project docs, starting with STARTWORK.md and falling back to other references if missing.
argument-hint: [task description]
---

1. First, read **STARTWORK.md** as the primary guide for starting the work.  
2. If **STARTWORK.md** is not available, then sequentially fall back to:  
   - **CLAUDE.md**  
   - **MEMORY.md**  
   - **ARCHITECTURE_FSD.md**  
   - **Frontend_TDD.md**  
   - **DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md**  
3. Extract the relevant workflows, coding rules, and project context from the documents.  
4. Use the extracted information to **set up the correct work environment and development approach** for the given task.  
5. Summarize the key points as an **initial checklist** before starting implementation.
